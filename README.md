# Sprig

Hello and welcome to my incredibly messy repo. This is for my sprig game project, a maze game following the Hack club jam(although to what I want it to be). Here's a link to the jam - https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/sprig. 

To follow my timeline, please check my commits because starting, I thought I needed to make a new file each time I documented progress. Not very smart and I have now learned that. 

The inspiration for my game came from my friend Portia. I knew I wanted to make a game, but didn't know what type. She suggested a cat cafe, so here we are. When she suggested that, we had just bought some bubble tea so I decided to add that to the game(I also absolutely love bubble tea!!!). 

I have banked a lot of hours so I will ship an unfinished version of the game named, "Unfinished Cat Cafe." The JS for that file will be in a file with the same name. When I can bank more hours, I will finish the game, still using the "last new file" as a way to document it. I will then and ship it, naming it "The Cat Cafe"

Thanks for listening to me yap and excuse my typos in my commits :)
